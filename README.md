# Project

This project is to create a countdown timer using js and display on a html page. 

How it works:
1) The default timer is a countdown to next year

2) The "Set Timer" button will take the user to another page to:
- Set the date and time they want 
- Set the name of the event

3) If they want to stop the timer, they would just need to press the "Pause" button
